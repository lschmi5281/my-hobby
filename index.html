<h1>Driving</h1>

<p>I really enjoy driving. When I have free time, I like to get in the car and drive.</p>

<p>I enjoy drives because I get to go around and see the town.  It is also very calming and stress-free.</p>

<h2>When I Can Drive...</h2>

<p>I have to wait 'til I can drive on my own.  I will get my restricted soon.  When I get my restricted, I can drive for certain times.  Then when I get my full license, I can drive on my own at any time.  I am excited to drive on my own because I can go do my own thing and not need a ride from someone.  It will come with a lot of freedom.</p>
<p> I'm also excited to get my first car.  I really like cars.  I really like sports cars and trucks.  I think it would be cool to have a <a href="http://www.liftedtrucks.com/">lifted</a>  yellow jeep and get accessories for it and lights.  I'm still thinking about what I want my car to be.  My dream car is always changing too, but it was a <a href="http://www.porsche.com/">Porsche</a> Cayman GTS in agate grey.  Here are the two cars... </p>

<h2>Where I Drive...</h2>

<p>I like to drive downtown.  I go to bigger downtowns, where I can walk around parks.  Also, I really like going to smaller, more country, downtowns.  When I go to smaller downtowns, I like to go get ice cream with everyone I brought and hang out.</p>
<p>I also like riding in the car with my friends when they are driving.  One of my close friends loves driving, like me.  I like to go on rides with him because he knows all the cool and twisty roads to go on.  We have a lot of fun because we both love cars and driving.  He's been driving longer than me, so he can do more.  For example, he knows how to drift and race cars. </p>
